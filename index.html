				<div id = "text_box" class = "relative_center" style = "position:relative;top:10px;">We're now nearly 7,800 meters below the surface. This is the home of the Hadal Snailfish, which was until late 2011 the deepest that scientists had ever found fish before. This fish contains a protein that allows its cells to remain functional at the high pressures found in the sea. </div>

			<span id = "oil_box">
				<div id = "text_box" class = "relative_center" style = "position:relative;top:10px;">We've reached a depth of 10,700 meters. It is around this depth that the world's deepest oil drilling sites, Deepwater Horizon, was active until the 2010 disaster that resulted in it becoming inoperable. </div>

				<div id = "text_box" class = "relative_center" style = "position:relative;top:10px;">We've approaching the lowest known point in the sea. Even at this depth, life is prosperous in the form of soft, single-celled organisms that resemble some of Earth's earliest life forms.</div>

				<div id = "text_box" class = "relative_center" style = "position:relative;top:10px;">It is at this depth that we find the lowest known point in the sea, otherwise known as Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench. It is thought that there are other points that are much deeper, as we have only currently explored about 10 percent of the world's oceans.</div>
